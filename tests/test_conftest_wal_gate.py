"""The conftest WAL gate must agree with fool_state, and must not import it.

``tests/conftest.py::_wal_is_usable`` duplicates the SQLite WAL-reset version
predicate instead of importing ``fool_state``. That is deliberate: importing
``fool_state`` during collection caches ``DEFAULT_DB_PATH`` from the real
``~/.hermes`` before the per-test ``FOOL_HOME`` redirect, which makes tests
read the developer's live production database.

Duplication needs a guard, so these tests pin the two implementations in
agreement across the documented upstream boundaries.
