"""Contract test: install.sh stamps the install method next to the code tree
($INSTALL_DIR), not into the shared $FOOL_HOME.

Background (shared-$FOOL_HOME bug)
------------------------------------
$FOOL_HOME is a data directory users frequently bind-mount into a Docker
gateway as well (``~/.hermes:/opt/data``). The published image stamps 'docker'
there on boot, so if install.sh had written its 'git' marker into the same
$FOOL_HOME the two installs would fight over one slot — and the container,
booting last, would win and wrongly make the host install look like 'docker'
(blocking ``fool update``).

The fix: detect_install_method() reads a CODE-scoped stamp first, and the
installer writes ``git`` into $INSTALL_DIR (the git checkout, e.g.
``~/.hermes/hermes-agent``), which is unique to this install and immune to the
shared data dir.
